Cisco-Networking-Projects

A collection of Cisco Packet Tracer labs and networking projects created by Meshack Nyongesa.
Each project is documented with topology files, exported device configs, troubleshooting notes, and screenshots.

Projects
- `03-Printer-Network/` — Shared printer across two LANs (DHCP clients + static printer IP).
- (Add new folders for DHCP, VLANs, NAT, ACLs, routing protocols, etc.)

Workflow
- Work locally in Packet Tracer and save incremental versions in `versions/`.
- Publish milestone files (`topology-final.pkt`, exported configs, README, and screenshots).
- Use branches for big features (e.g., `feature/vlan`) and tag milestones.
